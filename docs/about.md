RecifeJs is a powerful MVC Framework for GraphQL in NodeJS. Its principle is to compile typescript and creates graphql schemas in a simple and objective way.

RecifeJs delivers security in creating graphql schemes through the powers of typescript. It is no longer necessary to declare Types and Resolvers.

## Getting started

In a few seconds you can use RecifeJs through our [CLI](introduction-cli.md). Run the following commands:

```bash
npx recife-cli project my-project-name
cd my-project-name
npm run server
```
