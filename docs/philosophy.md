title: Philosophy of RecifeJs
---

Recifejs is structured around a philosophy. This philosophy aims to make clear the objectives of this framework and the team of maintainers.

## Our philosophy

1. **Open source** project developed by the community for community;
2. **Facilitate** the use of graphql through typescript resources;
3. Ensure **security** when creating graphql schemes;
4. **Sustainable** API with as few changes as possible;
5. Allow maximum **flexibility** in the use of typescript;
6. A flexible and **configurable** structure;
7. **Documentation** of all possible features and configurations;
8. Possibility of using all **graphql resources** for server;
9. Contain a **robust CLI** that encompasses project standards;

If you believe that we should insert some more point in philosophy feel free to contribute.
